- How the build environment works
    - Linux Environment
        - ssh, navigate, gcc, make, etc.
        - gcc makes .o files
        - a.out file
    - Cpp file
        - <iostream> is a standard directory for printing
            - No functions are built into C
                - Import everything
                - There are libraries builtin
                    - but you have to include them at the top of the file
        - Hello world
        - programs start at main() function
    - Multiple Functions in Cpp file
        - Hello world part 2
        - programs start at main, but you can call other functions in main
    - Header File
        - Hello Universe
        - How to connect extra files
            - change in gcc compiler functions (make file support) 
            - define functions in other files
        - #include pre-processor code
        - How you include code libraries
            - <> is for standard and “” is for user defined
            - ^ technically the same, just a formality
- Basics
    - Data types
        - Variables
            - store data
            - all data has a type
            - data types let compiler know what to do with the data and how to store data
        - Types
            - int = 4B
            - float = 4B (floating point aka number with a decimal point)
            - double = 8B (double length float aka stores more decimal points higher precision)
            - char = 1B
            - bool = 1B (boolean which is True or False)
    - Operators
        - +
            - Addition
        - -
            - Subtraction
        - *
            - Multiplication
        - /
            - Division
        - %
            - Mod (Remainder)
        - ==
            - equals
        - !=
            - not equals
        - < (and <=)
            - less than (or equal to)
        - > (and >=)
            - greater than (or equal to)
        - ||
            - OR
        - &&
            - AND
        - !
            - NOT
        - (condition a) ? (b) : (c)
            - if condition a, use b. Else use c
            - ex (1==1) ? 5 : 4
                - expression will equal 5
            - ex (1==0) ? 5 : 4
                - expression will equal 4
        - incremental
            - ++ (--)
            - += (-=)
            - *= (/=, %=)
    - Logical Statements
        - if
            - if the (statement) is true, then run the {code}
        - else
            - but if the previous statment was false, then run the {code}
        - {} groups the code to run
            - however if there are no braces, then the statment applies to the next line only.
            - this lets us do things like this:
                - if (statement 1) {
                      do something;
                  } else if (statement 2) {
                      do something else;
                  } else {
                      finally do last thing;
                  }
    - Loops
        - while loop
            - break
            - continue
            - do while
        - for loop
            - similar but used more to increment
            - run order:
                - for ( 1. this runs first; 
                        1. if this part is true, run code, else break; 
                        2. run this then repeat 2nd statement) {
                   }
    - Arrays
        - used for storing a series (or set) of numbers
            - ex. [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
            - ex. [4, 2, 7, 6, 2, 7, 9, 8]
        - index an element of the array with []
            - ex. array_variable[0]
                - returns the first element of the array
            - ex. array_variable[5]
                - returns the 6th element of the array
        - for loops are useful
            - go through each element of an array easily
    - Pointers
        -
