- How the build environment works
    - Linux Environment
        - ssh, navigate, gcc, make, etc.
        - gcc makes .o files
        - a.out file
    - Cpp file
        - <iostream> is a standard directory for printing
            - No functions are built into C
                - Import everything
                - There are libraries builtin
                    - but you have to include them at the top of the file
        - Hello world
        - programs start at main() function
    - Multiple Functions in Cpp file
        - Hello world part 2
        - programs start at main, but you can call other functions in main
    - Header File
        - Hello Universe
        - How to connect extra files
            - change in gcc compiler functions (make file support) 
            - define functions in other files
        - #include pre-processor code
        - How you include code libraries
            - <> is for standard and “” is for user defined
            - ^ technically the same, just a formality
- Functional Programming
    - Data types
        - Variable
            - store data
            - all data has a type
            - data types let compiler know what to do with the data and how to store data
                - for ex.:
                    - int = 4B
                    - float = 4B (floating point aka number with a decimal point)
                    - double = 8B (double length float aka stores more decimal points higher precision)
                    - char = 1B
                    - bool = 1B (boolean which is True or False)
